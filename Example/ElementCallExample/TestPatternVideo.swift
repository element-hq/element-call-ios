/// Pushes generated frames into whatever slots the stage has mounted, at something like a call's
/// frame rate.
///
/// This is what makes the harness worth having for the renderer rather than only for the layout.
/// With avatars in every tile, fitting against filling, zoom, pan and — above all — the shape of the
/// picture *through* a move are all invisible, and a move is the hardest thing to look at closely in
/// a real call.
///
/// Sizes differ by member on purpose. A 16:9 landscape picture full screen on an upright phone is
/// the case this feature exists for, and a portrait one beside it is the control: whether a border
/// runs off the edges or has black beside it is the whole question, and one answer is not proof.
///
/// **Frames are made off the main thread**, as a real call's are: the decoder offers them from its
/// own task. Generating them on main, on a run loop timer, charged the harness's scroll with work
/// the app never does, which is the wrong way round for anything measured with it. A dispatch timer
/// also has no run loop mode to get wrong: a default-mode `Timer` stopped while a touch was being
/// tracked, and starved the tiles of frames for exactly the length of a gesture.
