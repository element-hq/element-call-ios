/// A call screen with no call behind it, for driving by hand or by a UI test.
///
/// It opens on a catalogue of fixtures and minimizes back to it, which is how the Android harness
/// works and for the same reason: the handover between full screen and minimized is the host's job,
/// and a harness that cannot leave the call screen cannot show it going wrong.
///
/// `-fixture <key>` skips the catalogue and opens that fixture directly, and `-scenario <name>` plays
/// that scenario file, so a test starts where it means to rather than tapping its way there through
/// a menu it does not care about. With the argument present the hierarchy is exactly what it was
/// before the catalogue existed. The keys are shared with Android's sample: see
/// `element-call-feature-hq/harness/fixtures.md`.
///
/// `-chromeReturnDelay <seconds>` replaces how long chrome a scroll hid takes to come back. For the
/// UI tests that check it went: on a slow CI runner the check came after the default two seconds,
/// and saw it already back.
