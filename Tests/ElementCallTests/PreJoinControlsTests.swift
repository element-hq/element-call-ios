/// The control bar is drawn whenever the screen is maximized, with no gate on the connection, so it
/// is live from `.joining` onwards -- a good twenty seconds on a slow join. Every tap there used to
/// be dropped: `setMicrophoneMuted` forwarded to a nil `call`, CallKit's echo landed in
/// `applySystemMute` which is itself `guard let call`, and `refresh()` returned before it could draw
/// the button's new state. The microphone was then published unmuted regardless.
///
/// `ElementCallController.fake(connection:)` is exactly the state under test: a room, and no call.
///
/// The tests that wait on a screen use `deferFulfillment`, the helper the host reads its own tests
/// with: start watching, act, then fulfil. Watching before the act is the point -- a value that
/// lands between the two cannot be missed.
