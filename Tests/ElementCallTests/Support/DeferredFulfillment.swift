/// Starts consuming now, waits later: the sequence is already being read before the act, so an
/// emission that lands between the two cannot be missed, and `until` skips the ones the act did not
/// cause -- a screen republishes for its own reasons.
///
/// A trimmed copy of the host's helper, `UnitTests/Sources/TestUtilities/DeferredFulfillment.swift`
/// in element-x-ios, which 65 of its test files read this way. Keeping the shape means a host
/// engineer reads these tests without learning anything new. Only the async-sequence half is here:
/// the Combine half needs an `ObservableObject`, and the call screen's state is `@Observable`.
/// Every value `read` produces, sampled once per scheduling turn.
///
/// `Observations` is the event-driven source and reads better, and it is what this used to use. It
/// samples *between* iterations, though, so a change landing in the gap is never seen, and there is
/// no bound on how wide that gap gets: suites run in parallel, this all needs the main actor, and
/// `PreviewTests` holds it for 35 seconds on CI. That is what failed there -- `.noOutput` on a test
/// whose own duration was 33 seconds, so it had waited and the transition had gone past it.
///
/// Re-reading cannot miss a transition because it never waits for one; it asks what the value is
/// now. Losing the sampling gap is also what lets these tests run below iOS 26, which `Observations`
/// needs and which would have made them skip silently rather than fail.
